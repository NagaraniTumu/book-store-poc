        "description": "From Angular core team member and creator of the router About This Book Written by the creator of the Angular router, giving you the best information straight from the source Get full coverage of the entire Angular Router library and understand exactly how every command works Essential for all serious users of Angular who need to manage states within their applications Who This Book Is For To get the most from this book, you should already have a good understanding of Angular and general web development. What You Will Learn Understand the role of the Angular router and how to make the most of it Build and parse complex URLs Learn about the componentless and empty-path routes Take control of states in your application Make use of imperative navigation Understand guards and how they can benefit your applications Optimize configuration and run tests on your routing In Detail Managing state transitions is one of the hardest parts of building applications. This is especially true on the web, where you also need to ensure that the state is reflected in the URL. In addition, you might want to split applications into multiple bundles and load them on demand. Doing this transparently isn't easy. The Angular router solves these problems. Using the router, you can declaratively specify application states, manage state transitions while taking care of the URL, and load bundles on demand. This book is a complete description of the Angular router written by its designer. It goes far beyond a how-to-get-started guide and talks about the library in depth. The mental model, design constraints, and the subtleties of the API-everything is covered. You'll learn in detail how to use the router in your own applications. Predominantly, you'll understand the inner workings of the router and how you can configure it to work with any edge cases you come across in your sites. Throughout the book, you'll see examples from real-world use in the MailApp application. You can view the full source of this application and see how the router code works to manage the state of the application and define what is visible on screen. Reading this book will give you deep insights into why the router works the way it does and will make you an Angular router expert. Style and approach This is an extremely practical book full of code examples and descriptions to help you understand the inner workings of the Angular router.",

        "description": "When developers move beyond building simple web sites or small applications, things get complicated. Managing data gets messy, handling browser incompatibilities takes time, juggling competing user interactions and integrating the work of multiple developers gets tricky. The Angular framework handles these common problems, making it ideal for writing large-scale web applications that can be maintained, extended, and tested. Because it's popular, it offers a well-supported code base, vibrant community, and rich ecosystem. Best of all, Angular emphasizes performance and focuses on mobile apps by being compact and memory efficient. Angular in Action teaches readers modern application development with Angular. It begins with the basics, such as key features of TypeScript, newer ES6 syntax and concepts, and details about the tools needed to write professional Angular applications. Next, readers learn how to build an Angular application from scratch. Using many examples, the book teaches the core parts of Angular, such as Components, the Router, and Services. It also covers techniques like server-side rendering and incrementally adding Angular to existing Angular applications. Finally, if offers insight into advanced skills, such as testing, tooling options, and performance tuning.

        "description": "Develop smaller, lighter web apps that are simple to create and easy to test, extend, and maintain as they grow. This hands-on guide introduces you to AngularJS, the open source JavaScript framework that uses Modelâ€“viewâ€“controller (MVC) architecture, data binding, client-side templates, and dependency injection to create a much-needed structure for building web apps. Guided by two engineers who worked on AngularJS at Google, youâ€™ll walk through the frameworkâ€™s key features, and then build a working AngularJS appâ€”from layout to testing, compiling, and debugging. If you have JavaScript experience, youâ€™ll learn how AngularJS helps reduce the complexity of your web app. Dive deep into Angularâ€™s building blocks and learn how they work together Gain maximum flexibility by separating logic, data, and presentation responsibilities with MVC Assemble your full app in the browser, using client-side templates Use AngularJS directives to extend HTML with declarative syntax Communicate with the server and implement simple caching with the $http service Use dependency injection to improve refactoring, testability, and multiple environment design Get code samples for common problems you face in most web apps",

        "description": "This book offers a concise introduction to the angular momentum, one of the most fundamental quantities in all of quantum mechanics. Beginning with the quantization of angular momentum, spin angular momentum, and the orbital angular momentum, the author goes on to discuss the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for a two-component system. After developing the necessary mathematics, specifically spherical tensors and tensor operators, the author then investigates the 3-j, 6-j, and 9-j symbols. Throughout, the author provides practical applications to atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics. These include partial-wave expansions, the emission and absorption of particles, the proton and electron quadrupole moment, matrix element calculation in practice, and the properties of the symmetrical top molecule.",
